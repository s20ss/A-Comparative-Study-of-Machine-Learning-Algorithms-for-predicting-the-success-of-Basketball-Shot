# A-Comparative-Study-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-predicting-the-success-of-Basketball-Shot
In this project I have used the NBA Shot logs dataset from the Kaggle repository ( https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs/data )
for predicting the success of the shot taken during various NBA matches played during the NBA season.I have used various machine learning algorithms for supervised learning like Multi Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, K nearest neighbours.
